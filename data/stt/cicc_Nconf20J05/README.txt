Here Nconf=20 is fixed and we just change the Ne values
Don't focus on different initial conditions (momentum distributions) so much. 
Analogous to Adrian's focus on Nconf=10, Ne=5,8, for us Nconf=20 and Ne=5,10 is a sufficient balance of realistic and interesting

NB we are using the outdated Jsd=0.5 for all the data
