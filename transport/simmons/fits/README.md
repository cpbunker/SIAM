Conductance fit results for each temperature dataset of the Mn data.

Folder names refer to which dIdV_xxx function is called as the conductance model. Note that for sin, lorentz_zero, and lorentz fits, the imp and mag fits need to be subtracted first.

The arguments of dIdV_xxx that come after Vb are the fitting parameters. The fitted values are stored as results.npy and the fitting bounds as bounds.npy
