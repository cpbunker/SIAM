Outline of procedure for fitting MnPc data with oscillations.py.

Description of the fitting parameters:
eps0 (eV) the band width appearing in the impurity scattering term.
        Typically order 0.001.
g3 (A/V/eV^2) the strength of the impurity scattering term, typically order 0.1
g2 (A/V/eV^2) the background to the impurity scattering term, typically order 0.1.
epsc (eV) the surface magnon activation energy. Typically order 0.1. We expect
        this to go to zero under sufficiently high external magnetic fields.
g1 (A/V/eV^2) the strength of the surface magnon term. Typically order 1
Gamma (eV) the coupling of the insulating film to the leads.
        Typically order 0.001
V0 (V) the experimental offset of the voltage. Typically order 0.001
T_surf (K) the temperature of the ferrimagnetic NCO surface. Can be higher
        than the nominal temperature T due to ohmic heating effects there.
tau0 (unitless) prefactor multiplying the molecular island transmission.
        Typically order 0.01.
EC (eV) the charging energy of the island. Typically of order 0.001. The
        period of the dI/dVb oscillations are 4*EC.
T_film (K) the temperature within the insulating film. Could lag the nominal
        temperature if the latter is raised non-adiabatically.

Classes of fitting parameters:
(i) Physical background parameters: eps0, epsc, g1, g2, g3, Gamma
(ii) Experimental background parameters: V0, T_surf
(iii) Oscillation parameters: tau0, EC
(iv) T_film

Levels of fitting, from most to least rigorous:
(a) lorentz: the oscillation terms are computed from the numerical integral with
    full temperature dependence included (therefore slow). The code then auto-
    matically updates the parameters to minimize the error w/r/t single dataset
(b) lorentz_zero: the oscillation terms are approximated by the analytical form
    of the integral at T=0 (therefore faster then lorentz). Parameters
    are again updated automatically to minimize the error w/r/t single dataset
(c) by-hand freezing, the physical background parameters are not allowed to
    update, but are instead frozen to ensure physical reasonableness / good
    fitting behavior across datasets

The data is organized so that each data folder was taken on about the same
calendar day, and at the same B field. There are in general different data
sets within each data folder which differ by nominal temperature.

The entire fitting procedure consists of:
(1) Applying (a) to (i)-(iii), while (iv) is frozen to the nominal temp, for
    - the HIGHEST temperature dataset in the data folder, to find the
      best result for eps0
    - the LOWEST temperature dataset in the data folder, to find the
      best results for the rest of (i).
    Subsequently, all of (i) is treated at (c) for ALL data sets in the
    data folder.
(2) Applying (b) to (ii)-(iii), dropping data that is not within a few standard
    devs of this fit (removing outliers)
(3) Applying (b) to (ii)-(iii), to find the best results for (ii). Subsequently
    (ii) is treated at (c) within THIS dataset only
(4) Applying (a) to (iii)-(iv) to get final results

NB Gamma and T_film should never be unfrozen at the same time, since they both
control the smearing. In (1) we get a "1st order" guess for Gamma based on the
"0th order" guess for T_film. We could iterate higher if desired.
